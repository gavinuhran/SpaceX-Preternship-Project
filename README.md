# SpaceX Preternship Project for Ryan Green
## Created by Gavin Uhran, Mike Prieto, & Tom Henry
### Description
This repository will host our code as we develop a data visualization GUI for Ryan Green, a buyer/seller at SpaceX. This project is not for the company SpaceX, but for a specific employee and University of Notre Dame alum whom we are partnering with.

### Future Improvement
This application is currently under development and the README will be updated when development is complete.
